# Implementing automated section control sprayers for optimising pesticide application in orchards

\ 

### Description   
A decision analysis on optimizing pesticide application in orchards with an LiDAR sensor and an automated section controlled sprayer.

\ 

### Decision maker: farmer   
* Farmer is the main stakeholder who makes the decision whether or not to buy a modern sprayer which is able to minimise pesticide application rates

\ 

### Stake holders:  
* farmers 
* manufacturers 
* government 
* consumers 
* society 
* food retailers 
* water suppliers 
* agrochemical companies 
* NGOs 
* local biodiversity
* beekeepers

\ 

### Problems:    
* Some common agrochemicals will be banned in the near future for various reasons (e.g. overuse) 
* 
* Excessive use of pesticides can cause unwanted effects (e.g. resistances)  
* Agrochemicals are costly $\Rightarrow$ reduction is welcome
